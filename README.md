# Detecam
Cloud-Based Camera System Supported with Artificial Intelligence Support
# Project Overview
Detecam is a cloud-based camera system enhanced with artificial intelligence to provide real-time object detection and analysis. This project utilizes machine learning models deployed in the cloud to process camera feeds efficiently and accurately.

# Features
Real-Time Object Detection: Instantly identifies and tracks objects within the cameraâ€™s field of view.
Cloud-Based Processing: Offloads computationally intensive tasks to cloud servers for fast and reliable processing.
Scalability: Easily scales to accommodate multiple cameras and high-resolution feeds.
User-Friendly Interface: Accessible and intuitive interface for managing camera feeds and reviewing detections.
Customizable AI Models: Option to switch between AI models based on specific detection needs.

# Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV: For image and video processing.
TensorFlow / PyTorch: Core deep learning frameworks for training and deploying models.
Flask / FastAPI: Back-end framework to handle API requests.
AWS / Azure Cloud: For hosting the model and processing data in the cloud.
